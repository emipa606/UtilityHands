This is a fork (!) of the mod Spoon Hands that has not been updated since B19:
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1520212939
	
Adds four new basic hand-prostetics, each with its own properties.

[list]
[*]Spoon-hand: You can eat better, at least soup.
[*]Fork-hand: You can eat better, but not soup.
[*]Knife hand: You can eat a little better and its easier to hurt people.
[*]Scissor-hand: Harvesting crops is your thing, Edward.
[/list]

Requires either of the two EPOE-mods (original or forked)
