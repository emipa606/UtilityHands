	<description>This is a fork (!) of the mod Spoon Hands that has not been updated since B19:
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1520212939
	
Adds four new basic hand-prostetics, each with its own properties.
Spoon-hand: You can eat better, at least soup.
Fork-hand: You can eat better, but not soup.
Knife hand: You can eat a little better and its easier to hurt people.
Scissor-hand: Harvesting crops is your thing, Edward.

Requires either of the two EOPE-mods (original or forked)
