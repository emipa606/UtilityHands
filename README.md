This is a fork (!) of the mod Spoon Hands that has not been updated since B19:
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1520212939
	
Adds four new basic hand-prostetics, each with its own properties.



- Spoon-hand: You can eat better, at least soup.
- Fork-hand: You can eat better, but not soup.
- Knife hand: You can eat a little better and its easier to hurt people.
- Scissor-hand: Harvesting crops is your thing, Edward.



Requires either of the two EPOE-mods (original or forked)
